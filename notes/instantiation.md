A process of replacing variables in first-order logic with suitable values.

There are two types corresponding to the two types of quantifiers.

Universal Instantiation:
: $$ \frac{\forall x \quad \alpha}{\text{SUBST}(\{v/g\},\alpha)} $$

Existential Instantiation:
: $$ \frac{\exists x \quad \alpha}{\text{SUBST}(\{v/k\},\alpha)} $$
