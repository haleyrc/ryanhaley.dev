An inference rule which relates a given conditional rule and the independent sentence of the conditional to the dependent portion.

This is just a long-winded way of stating that if one thing depends on another being true, and we know that the latter is true, then the former is true. It is written as

$$ \frac{\alpha \Rightarrow \beta, \alpha}{\beta} $$

Example:
: If it's snowing, then it's winter.
: It is snowing.
: Must be winter.

$$ \frac{\text{Snow} \Rightarrow \text{Winter}, \text{Snow}}{\text{Winter}} $$
