title: Rename
---

An operation which allows the renaming of results returned from a set operation and possibly renaming the attributes. Useful for referring to the results or for referring to a relation by more than one name such as when referring to two separate results of an operation on the same relation. The operation is represented using the $$\rho$$ symbol.

Example:

$$\rho_{X(A_1,A_2\cdots)}(E)$$

renames the results returned from operation $$E$$ to $$X$$ with attributes named $$A_1,A_2,\cdots$$.
