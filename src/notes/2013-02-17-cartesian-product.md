title: Cartesian (Cross) Product
---

The Cartesian product represents a combinatorial operation between two relations. The number of attributes in the result is equal to the sum of the number of attributes in each relation. The number of tuples returned is equal to the product of the number of tuples in each relation.

Example:

If $$R$$ is a relation with attributes $$A_1$$ and $$A_2$$ and $$S$$ is a relation with attributes $$B_1$$ and $$B_2$$, then

$$R \times S$$

returns a relation $$Q$$ with attributes $$A_1,A_2,B_1,B_2$$.
