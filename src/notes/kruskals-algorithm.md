\$$ O(E\lg V) \$$

Algorithm to create a minimum spanning tree by growing a forest of minimum cost trees.

At each step, add the lowest cost edge which does not not form a cycle until all edges have been considered.

Example:
: [figure]
: [figure]
: [figure]
: [figure]
: [figure]
: [figure]
: [figure]

Final MST (cost 11):
: [figure]
