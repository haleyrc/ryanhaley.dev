title: Projection
---

A projection operation removes attributes which are not in the "projection list", returning only those which are desired, with duplicates eliminated. The operation is represented using the $$\Pi$$ symbol.

Example:

$$\Pi_{\text{tag},\text{age}}(\text{Dog})$$

returns the tag and age attributes from the Dog relation.
