title: Entity-Relationship Model
---

An abstract way to describe a database using a small number of basic types: entities, attributes, and relationships. Usually displayed graphically using standardized shapes and layouts.

Entities are the "objects" of the model and are represented using labeled rectangles. 

Entities have attributes which are represented by labeled ovals and are connected to the entities which they describe. Attributes can be derived, that is they are calculated based on the value of another attribute, and are represented as dashed ovals. Alternatively, they can be multi-valued and are represented as double ovals. Keys are represented using underlined attribute names.

Relationship sets are represented as labeled diamonds and express various relationship types such as "has a" relationships.

Cardinality in ER diagrams is represented using various arrow types; singular cardinality by a directed line and multiple cardinality by a straight line.
