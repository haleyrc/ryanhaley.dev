Keys are used to identify entities in a database schema and come in a variety of types.

Super keys of an entity set are a collection of one or more attributes which uniquely identify a single entity in the collection. A super key which is minimal is known as a candidate key.

A primary key is one candidate key which is chosen to identify a single entity across the collection set.

A key for a relationship set is composed of all primary keys from the relationships component entities.

A foreign key is an attribute which refers to a primary key of a second relation.
