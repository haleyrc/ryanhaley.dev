I'm in the process of learning React for a project at work, so I've been looking for small projects
just to help cement the basic concepts in my head. Today I threw together something that should
actually prove useful since I'm currently looking for a house.

All it does is let you tweak some values and give you some (potentially very specific to my
situation) useful numbers to help make a quick decision.

Do keep in mind that this is a toy project that is currently in flux. I do intend to refactor this,
but as of the time of the original writing it is extremely janky and the code is atrocious. That
said, it works. I can live with that for now.

If you'd like to test it out, click [here](/page/calculator/).
