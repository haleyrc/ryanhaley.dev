## Introduction

This will probably end up being more of a rant than a well-reasoned...anything,
but I wanted to get some thoughts down about the current state of programming
and how it relates to developers at different skill levels.

Full disclosure here: I am not a brilliant programmer, and I don't work at a
large, well-known shop full of 10x-ers. Nor am I completely new to the scene or
working for a plucky startup with more ideas than engineers.

I am an average programmer working for a successful software company in a very
niche vertical market with _enough_ but by no means _unlimited_ capital. At my
company I'm at the top of the talent pool, and in our industry as a whole I'd
guess I'm pretty high up as well. But the types of problems we solve are so
different from the ones you hear coming from huge companies like Google and Uber
that it sounds like an almost alien profession altogether.

I say all of this to give some context to the fact that I'm _very_ interested in
the largely unpublished struggles of low- to mid-range software shops that sell
software to actual end users instead of to other software companies and at a
scale that will never require optimizing queries from 300μs to 180μs.

Somewhat related is an interest in how programming is perceived at various
levels of skill across the entire software engineering discipline. This stems
largely from my position as somehow who completed...most of a computer science
degree, but who entered the industry extremely fresh and with few mentors
available with more background than I had.

## Background

Personal CS background, company background, my time at company

## Motivation

JQuery easier than React, serverless as the future, Visual Basic is best

## Conclusion

There isn't an "intermediate" level that is satisfying. Tooling is either easy
and approachable, or hard and production-ready. Lack of mentorship from one to
the next can make someone stall out.
